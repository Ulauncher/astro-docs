Ulauncher comes with built-in color themes you can choose between. In addition to that you can install community contributed themes or create you own.

## Installing Community Themes

If you find a [community contributed theme](https://gist.github.com/gornostal/02a232e6e560da7946c053555ced6cce) you like, this is how you install it:

1. Ensure that you have the user theme directory `mkdir -p ~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes`
2. Move to the user theme directory `cd ~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes`
3. Clone the theme `git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/<theme_name>.git` (replace with the actual user name and theme name)
4. Open Ulauncher Preferences and select the theme
